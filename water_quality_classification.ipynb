    "## Classification for Water Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our goal is to develop and train a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying the water quality index into three categories: Low, Medium, and High. To achieve this, we employ supervised machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given chemical parameters in drinking water, can we accurately calculate the water quality index, classify it accordingly, and make accurate predictions using machine learning models?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data is provided by the[ European Environmental Agency (EEA)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The features consist of chemical elements found in drinking water. The value range is set by the World Health Organization guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring Site ID:** Unique identification codes for monitoring locations following ISO standards.\n",
    "- **Time Sampling Date:** The date of measurement in Year-Month-Day format.\n",

    "# Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase of the project we will deep dive into the heart of the mission - developing and training machine learning models for the accurate classificaiton of the water quality index into distinct categories: **Low** - (Low level of polution in the water) , **Medium**, and **High** - (high level of popution in the water) that we have calculated in the prevoius part of this project. To accomplish this, we employ a variety of supervised machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Tree: Decision trees are a popular choice for classification tasks. They work by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step. This hierarchical structure makes it easy to interpret and visualize the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVMs are excellent for binary and multi-class classification tasks. They seek to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes while maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): KNN is a simple yet effective classification algorithm. It assigns a class label based on the majority class among its 'k' nearest neighbors. This model is non-parametric and can adapt to different data distributions."
