# Water Quality Classification Projcet:

This project employs machine learning techniques to classify the water quality in Europe using a dataset obtained from the European Environment Agency (EEA). The EEA dataset contains a vast amount of information on the quality and status of Europe's water resources, including rivers, lakes, groundwater bodies, transitional, coastal, and marine waters.


# Data Preparation:

The dataset is quite large (16GB), so a subset of it will be utilized for the project. The data preparation process includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as selecting relevant data, dealing with missing values, outliers, and scaling the data. The Water Quality Index (WQI) is calculated for each water resource to classify its quality., which includes:

- Selecting relevant data
- Creating custom datasets
- Dealing with missing values
- Dealing with outliers
- Calculating the Water Quality Index (WQI)
- Scaling the data


# Project Goal:

The goal of the project is to use the Water Quality Index (WQI) to classify the quality of Europe's water resources accurately. The project containes all the neceassary code and documentationto replicate it.


# Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- Scikit Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
